# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project SQL

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains code and data for the analysis of COVID-19 related statistics. The project focuses on exploring various aspects of the pandemic, including total cases vs. total deaths, death percentage, total cases vs. population, countries with the highest infection rate compared to their population, countries with the highest death count per population, continents with the highest death count per population, total new cases vs. total new deaths percentage, and total population vs. new vaccinations.

## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the world, affecting both public health and economies. This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data from various sources to gain insights into key metrics and trends related to the pandemic.

## Data Files

The project uses the following data files:
coviddeaths.xlsx: Contains data related to COVID-19 deaths by location and date.
covidvaccinations.xlsx: Contains data related to COVID-19 vaccinations by location, date, and continent.

Please ensure that these data files are placed in the appropriate directories within this repository before running the analysis.

## Analysis

The analysis covers a range of important topics:

1. **Total Cases vs. Total Deaths** - We examine the relationship between the total number of COVID-19 cases and the total number of deaths.

2. **Death Percentage** - We calculate the percentage of deaths relative to the total number of cases.

3. **Total Cases vs. Population** - We analyze the total number of COVID-19 cases relative to the population of each country.

4. **Countries with the Highest Infection Rate Compared to Population** - We identify countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.

5. **Countries with the Highest Death Count per Population** - We identify countries with the highest death counts relative to their population.

6. **Continents with the Highest Death Count per Population** - We analyze continents to identify those with the highest death counts relative to their population.

7. **Total New Cases vs. Total New Deaths Percentage** - We calculate the percentage of new cases relative to new deaths.

8. **Total Population vs. New Vaccinations** - We explore the relationship between a country's total population and the number of new vaccinations.

The code for this analysis can be found in the files.

By contributing to this project, you are helping to better understand the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on different regions and populations, which can contribute to informed decision-making and public health efforts.
