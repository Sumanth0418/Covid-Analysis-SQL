# COVID Data Analysis Project SQL
Overview

This GitHub repository contains code and data for analyzing COVID-19 vaccination and death data. The project utilizes two Excel files, namely coviddeaths.xlsx and covidvaccinations.xlsx, to explore data related to the locations that have been vaccinated, new vaccinations, vaccination rates by continents, and the dates with the highest number of vaccinated people.

Introduction


The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the world, and vaccination efforts have played a crucial role in combating the virus. This project aims to analyze COVID-19 vaccination and death data to gain insights into the following aspects:
-Total Cases vs Total Deaths and deathpercentage
-Total Cases vs population
-countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to population
-countries with the highest death count per population
-continents with highest death count per population
-Total new cases vs total new deaths percentage
-Total population vs new  vaccinations

Data Files


The project uses the following data files:
coviddeaths.xlsx: Contains data related to COVID-19 deaths by location and date.
covidvaccinations.xlsx: Contains data related to COVID-19 vaccinations by location, date, and continent.

Analysis
